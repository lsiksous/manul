The manul is a species of wild cat known as the Pallas's cat (Otocolobus
manul). The Pallas's cat is native to the grasslands and montane steppes of
Central Asia, including regions of Mongolia, China, Russia, and parts of Central
Asia. It's known for its distinctive appearance, with a stocky build, long fur,
flat face, and expressive eyes.

The Pallas's cat is well-adapted to its harsh, cold environment, with its dense
fur providing insulation against the cold and its low metabolism enabling it to
conserve energy. It's primarily a solitary and nocturnal hunter, preying on
small mammals, birds, and insects.

The Pallas's cat is also known by other names, including the manul, the steppe
cat, and the rock wildcat. It's considered a near-threatened species due to
habitat loss, degradation, and hunting pressures. Conservation efforts are
underway to protect its habitat and populations.

* Introduction

** Project Overview
   The aim of our project is to facilitate the creation of lab environments for
   a learning company that specializes in teaching Big Data courses. These courses
   are designed to provide students with hands-on experience in working with
   Hadoop distributions, including OSS, Cloudera, and MapR. Our toolbox offers
   easy deployment of these Hadoop distributions using various methods, allowing
   students to explore different deployment and configuration management
   techniques.

** Toolbox Features
   - *Hadoop Distributions:* Our toolbox supports the deployment of three main
     Hadoop distributions: OSS, Cloudera, and MapR. This variety allows students
     to gain exposure to different Hadoop platforms and understand their unique
     features and capabilities.
   - *Deployment Methods:* We provide multiple deployment methods to cater to
     different learning preferences and scenarios:
     - *Docker:* Students can deploy Hadoop environments using Docker containers,
       offering a lightweight and portable solution.
     - *Vagrant:* Virtual environments can be created using Vagrant, allowing
       students to set up Hadoop clusters on their local machines with ease.
     - *Terraform:* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enthusiasts can utilize Terraform
       to provision Hadoop clusters on cloud platforms or virtualization
       providers.
     - *Ansible:* Especially focused on Ansible, our toolbox emphasizes
       configuration management techniques, enabling students to automate the
       setup and management of Hadoop environments.
   - *Integrated Curriculum:* The courses offered by the learning company
     include comprehensive coverage of Hadoop concepts and hands-on labs using
     our toolbox. Students not only learn about Hadoop but also gain practical
     experience in deploying and managing Hadoop clusters using
     industry-standard tools like Docker, Vagrant, Terraform, and Ansible.

** Benefits
   - *Hands-on Learning:* By providing easy access to deployable Hadoop
     environments, our project enhances the hands-on learning experience for
     students, allowing them to apply theoretical concepts in real-world
     scenarios.
   - *Exposure to Multiple Platforms:* Students get exposure to a variety of
     Hadoop distributions, enabling them to understand the strengths and
     weaknesses of each platform and make informed decisions in their future
     career paths.
   - *Comprehensive Curriculum:* Our integrated curriculum ensures that students
     receive a holistic learning experience, covering both theoretical concepts
     and practical implementation using state-of-the-art tools.
   - *Git Collaboration:* We encourage students to contribute with git to this
     project so that they can learn Git workflows, including working in teams
     with branches and pull requests. Understanding Git collaboration is
     essential for effective teamwork and version control in software
     development projects. Learning these skills will prepare students for
     collaborative work environments and enhance their employability in the
     industry.


** Future Enhancements
   - *Enhanced Automation:* Continuously improving our automation capabilities, we
     aim to streamline the deployment and management processes further, reducing
     setup time and effort for students and instructors alike.

learning company.


[[file:media/topo.png]]


*** Docker

You can choose to deploy your cluster locally on a unix-like system (including a
pre-provisionned ubuntu virtual box running on the windows host provided by the
learning company).


*** Terraform

You can choose to deploy your cluster to the cloud (Azure).

**** Initialisation

#+begin_src shell
cd terraform && terraform init && terraform plan -out main.tfplan
#+end_src

**** Run terraform apply to apply the execution plan

  #+begin_src shell
  terraform apply main.tfplan
  #+end_src

**** Verify the results

  #+begin_src shell
# Get the Azure resource group name
resource_group_name=$(terraform output -raw resource_group_name)

# Get the virtual network name
virtual_network_name=$(terraform output -raw virtual_network_name)

# Use az network vnet show to display the details of the newly created virtual network
az network vnet show \
    --resource-group $resource_group_name \
    --name $virtual_network_name
  #+end_src

**** Clean up resources

#+begin_src shell
# Run terraform plan and specify the destroy flag
terraform plan -destroy -out main.destroy.tfplan

# Run terraform apply to apply the execution plan
terraform apply main.destroy.tfplan
#+end_src

** Automated Installation Using the MapR Installer (Layer 2)

MapR provides an installer that simplifies the process of setting up a cluster
by automating many of the steps. This method is recommended for users who want a
straightforward installation process and are willing to use a somewhat
standardized cluster configuration.

Steps Involved:
- Setup an installation node that can communicate with all other nodes in the
  cluster.
- Run the MapR Installer from a web-based interface provided by MapR, which
  guides you through the process.
- Select the services and features you wish to install (like MapR-FS, MapR-DB,
  Hadoop components, etc.).
- The installer automatically configures and deploys the selected services
  across the cluster.

To illustrate the installation of this distribution, we will use a vagrant
cluster that we have provisioned earlier.

1. Connect via ssh to your edge machine:

   #+begin_src shell
   vagrant ssh edge
   #+end_src
2. cd into manul directory and pull last version:

   #+begin_src shell
   cd manul
   git config --global --add safe.directory /home/vagrant/manul
   git pull
   #+end_src

3. Customize environment variables:

   #+begin_src shell
   cp templates/manul_env-template.sh manul_env.sh
   #+end_src

   Edit the file to reflect your desired values for important variables. It may
   contains secrets so it will not be synced on remote origin.

   #+begin_example
   vagrant@edge:~/manul$ cat manul_env.sh 
   #!/bin/bash

   export CLUSTER_NAME=manul.arpa

   # MapR distribution env variables
   #export HPE_USER=<HPE_USER>
   #export HPE_TOKEN=<HPE_TOKEN>

   export MAPR_USER=mapr
   export MAPR_PASSWD=mapr
   export MAPR_GID=5000
   export MAPR_UID=5000


   # OSS distribution env variables
   export HADOOP_USER=hadoop
   export HADOOP_PASSWD=hadoop
   #+end_example

   You should have obtained a passport from HPE. It is mandatory that you include
   it here. After that, source the file:

   #+begin_src shell
   source manul_env.sh
   #+end_src

4. Check ansible version:
   
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   vagrant@edge:~/manul$ ansible --version
   ansible 2.5.1   
     config file = /home/vagrant/manul/ansible.cfg
     configured module search path = [u'/home/vagrant/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
     ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible
     executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
     python version = 2.7.17 (default, Mar  8 2023, 18:40:28) [GCC 7.5.0]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

5. verify that vagrant configure environment suits to your need:

   #+begin_example
   vagrant@edge:~/manul$ head -10 tools/configure_environment.rb
   # configure_environment.rb
   NUM_NODES = 3
   NUM_CONTROLLER_NODE = 1
   IP_NTW = "10.0.1."
   CONTROLLER_IP_START = 2
   NODE_IP_START = 3
   #+end_example

   Normally, it should be the 3 nodes cluster that this document is based on. If
   you had made changes in the vagrant provisioning step, you will have to
   reflect them in this file.

6. Generate hosts file:

   #+begin_example
   vagrant@edge:~/manul$ tools/generate_hosts_file.sh
   Hosts file generated successfully.
   #+end_example

   You should obtain something like that:

   #+begin_example
   vagrant@edge:~/manul$ cat hosts
   127.0.0.1 localhost

   10.0.1.4 node01.manul.arpa node01
   10.0.1.5 node02.manul.arpa node02
   10.0.1.6 node03.manul.arpa node03
   10.0.1.3 edge.manul.arpa edge
   #+end_example
   
   Now copy this hosts file to /etc/hosts.

7. Check your inventory

   You must verify that your inventory is coherent with your hosts file:

   #+begin_example
   
   #+end_example

8. Run ansible playbook:

   #+begin_src shell
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mapr-configure.yml
   #+end_src

9. Now you should be able to launch the mapr installer (see Configuration chapter
   to continue installation):

   #+begin_src shell
   sudo /tmp/mapr-setup.sh -r https://$HPE_USER:$HPE_TOKEN@package.ezmeral.hpe.com/releases/
   #+end_src
